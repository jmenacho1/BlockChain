# Proof of Authority Development Chain Project
## Project Mission Statement: 
---
### Team - I am so excited to be finally presenting you with an exciting project.  This project will allow ZBank to reiterate its stated purpose to the rest of the Fintech industry: To be cutting edge in the technology and processes that it seeks to aline itself with on a daily basis.

### We are going to set up a private testnet blockchain in order to show the abilities of the technology to process transactions in a more efficient manner than the industry does so right now. In using a testnet Blockchain, we will be using seeking to hone in on the specific method in which we will utilize the blockchain technology. We will use the consensus algorithm "Proof of Authority (POA)." I think that a main benefit of using testnet is that the ie no real money involved and because that is the case - our team of engineers will be able to focus more on being creative in its approach and less worried about the level of money gained as being the main goal.

### In additon, POA is a good algo for out team because it is cheap as it doesnt use a lot of computing power and is a centralized algo.  As such, it is a rather ideal algo for us to use in development and testing.
